        the
        Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and also the Sukh Niwas where a trendy environment is synthetically

        alt="">
    <p>The City Palace, Jaipur is a royal residence and former administrative headquarters of the rulers of the Jaipur
        State in
        Jaipur, Rajasthan.[1] Construction started soon after the establishment of the city of Jaipur under the reign of
        Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, who moved his court to Jaipur from Amber, in 1727.[2] Jaipur remained the capital
        of the
        kingdom until 1949—when it became the capital of the present-day Indian state of Rajasthan—with the City Palace
        functioning as the ceremonial and administrative seat of the Maharaja of Jaipur.[2] The construction of the
        Palace was
        completed in 1732 and it was also the location of religious and cultural events, as well as a patron of arts,
        commerce,
        and industry. It was constructed according to the rules of vastushastra, combining elements of Mughal and Rajput
        architectural styles</p>

        grand
        scale. The building has a picturesque view of Man Sagar Lake, but owing to its seclusion from land is equally
        the focus
        of a viewpoint from the Man Sagar Dam on the eastern side of the lake in front of the backdrop of the
        surrounding
        Nahargarh ("tiger-abode") hills.</p>
